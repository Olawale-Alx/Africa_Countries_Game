Challenge: Guess the name of the state
What to import:
                pandas
                turtle
Set screen, screen title, screen image and add screen image to the turtle screen(screen.addshape and t.shape)
read the data in the .csv files for the name of the states and convert the data to a list
make a list datatype that we can append answer to whenever player makes a correct guess
use screen.textinput to collect data from the player and increase number of guesses by one
check if player input is 'exit', end the game and list out the total countries not collected by the player and put into a .csv file
use an if loop to check if the answer is in the list of countries. if right, append answer to guessed_countries
use the turtle.Turtle() to create a turtle, penup, hideturtle, check for state_data and get x,y coordinate from the csv file
t.goto()
turtle.write(answer)
use a while loop to continue playing if len of list datatype is < 50, if not end the while loop
